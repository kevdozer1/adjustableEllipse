# adjustableEllipse
Control bezier curves in a 3 dimensional space with user input via Hermite derivatives

# Overview
This is an OpenGL project written in Javascript and ran on an HTML page.

The program contains two frames. 

One frame contains two endpoints and two control points in which a Hermite curve is formed. A dotted line shows the unweighted curve, and the weighted curve is constructed in the second frame in red. An animation can be played showing the shape of this Hermite curve. The speed of this animation can be adjusted.

The second frame shows three vectors in a 3D space in which the red Hermite curve is drawn. A blue Hermite curve reconnects the red curve to create a complete shape. A star object controlled by a slider can trace the form of this completed shape.

# How to run
Extract all files from compressed folder and then open the HTML file to run the program.
